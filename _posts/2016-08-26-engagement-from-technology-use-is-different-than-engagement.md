  It's Wednesday morning, and Mom calls upstairs to me, "Eric, it's time to wake
  up! You don't want to be late, you have PLUS class today." I jump out of bed,
  get dressed with the first shirt and pants I see, then rush out of my room
  with a Bo Jackson T-shirt, mismatched socks and a serious case of bed head.
